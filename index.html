<p>I’m a software engineer at Google working on the Google Chrome web browser.  I currently work on how the browser uses multiple processes to keep web sites isolated from each other.</p>

<p>I finished my Ph.D. in 2009 at the University of Washington, where I worked with Steve Gribble and Hank Levy on web browser robustness and security research.  My thesis work aimed to make web browsers more like operating systems, since web pages have become full programs in their own right.</p>

<p>I’m an active ultimate frisbee player in Seattle, after playing at the club level at Rice University.  I also spend my free time hiking, kayaking, and skiing in the Northwest.</p>
